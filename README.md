## Overview

A **simplified deep learning demonstration project** for retail inventory management. This project showcases two neural network models working together to:

1. **Extract product data from invoice images** using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
2. **Forecast future import quantities** using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

**Target Audience:** Deep Learning Course Exam / Portfolio Project (Focus on ML models, NOT frontend complexity)

## TODO
